        "What to do": [
            "Stand with legs about hip-width apart. Have a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, with palms facing each other",
            "Have slight bend in knees, and bend at waist so that torso is slightly above parallel with ground. Back should be straight. Arms should be perpendicular with chest, slight bend in elbows. This is starting position",
            "With a tight core, exhale and lift dumbbells to sides until elbows are in line with shoulders. Pinky should be slightly higher than thumb, as if liquid was being poured out of dumbbell",
            "Inhale and lower dumbbell back to starting position"
        ],
        "Do NOT": [
            "Swing or rock body to generate momentum. Focus on using rear delt and upper back to move weights"
